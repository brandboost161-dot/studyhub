  "sourceText": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The process has two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is used to split water molecules and produce ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. Chlorophyll gives plants their green color because it reflects green light while absorbing red and blue wavelengths.",
